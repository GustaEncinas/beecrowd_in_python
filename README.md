# 📘 Beecrowd Python Solutions

This repository contains Python solutions to problems from the [Beecrowd](https://www.beecrowd.com.br/) competitive programming platform.

## 🎯 Purpose

The aim is to provide well-structured and understandable solutions that follow **competitive programming acceptance criteria**, using **only native Python libraries**.

Although the code isn't necessarily the shortest possible, it's written to be clean and clear — making it ideal for learning and reviewing.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The problems are organized into folders based on Beecrowd's official categories:

- `INICIANTE` (Beginner)
- `AD-HOC`
- `STRINGS`
- `ESTRUTURAS` (Data Structures)
- `MATEMÁTICA` (Mathematics)
- `PARADIGMAS` (Paradigms)
- `GRAFOS` (Graphs)
- `GEOMETRIA` (Geometry)
- `SQL`

Each directory contains `.py` files named with the problem number from Beecrowd. For example:
```
iniciante/

├── 1000.py

├── 1001.py

└── ...
```


## 🧠 Highlights

- ✅ Only **native Python libraries** used
